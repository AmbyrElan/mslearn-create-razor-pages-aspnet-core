# Create a web UI with ASP.NET Core

I completed the [Create a web UI with ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/create-razor-pages-aspnet-core/) Microsoft Training module.

In this training module I learned the basics of Razor Pages. I learned how to create a Razor Page, add a model, and add a page handler. I also learned how to use tag helpers to bind HTML elements to model properties and to generate URLs. Additionally, I learned how to use dependency injection to inject a service into a Razor Page.
